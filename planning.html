      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles,
        the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical
        rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous
        population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian economy was dominated by
        fishing or agriculture.</p>
