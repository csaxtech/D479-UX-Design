      <h2>Getting Around Paradise</h2>
      <p>Transportation: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small
        cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small
        airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of
        expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few
        years.</p>
      <p>Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every
        day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental
        cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are
        available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat
        and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is
        easy to explore on foot.</p>
