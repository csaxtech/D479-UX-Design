      <h2>Entertainment</h2>
      <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to
        visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history
        museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting
        several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie,
        taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-
        hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in
        Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.</p>
